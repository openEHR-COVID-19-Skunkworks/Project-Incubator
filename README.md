Archetypes and templates related to data sets representing all aspects of COVID-19 data recording and capture, including but not limited to risk assessment, contact tracing and reporting.

This 'Ninja' work is intended to be fast-moving and aligned with the actual deployments that we know already rely on the models here, so the intent will be to minimise breaking changes wherever possible but will take every opportunity to re-align with the formal 'Covid-19' project, as the opportunity arises.

For governed COVID-19 related archetypes and templates, see the COVID-19 project, available at https://ckm.openehr.org/ckm/projects/1013.30.81.
